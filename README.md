Our work presents a simple yet effective semi-supervised approach for person re-identification. 

We only provide the GOG feature of the VIPeR dataset in the 'Features' folder. For the GOG feature of the CUHK01 dataset, please download the GOG_CUHK01.zip file from the page  http://www.i.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~matsukawa/ReID.html.
